Hello This Is Axis Namir We talking Talking About fedora pre-built virtual machine for vmware The username is fedora password There is desktop enviroment Like Cinnamon And GNOME KDE .etc Many Desktop Enviroment is coming soon If you wish to do the download link is coming soon 
There Is Some Limitation On Fedora And Zorin
1 If you using Workstation 5 and older It will not Compatible 25H2 is the Stable one It works with player and fusion 
Its Possible That ESXi Wont Work Because We Would Do Fedora Server For VMware ESXi In Feb 18
Incase If Zorin OS Lite Would Work With 17.64 It Should Work When you Have 17.64
Any  Modern OS Use 7TB The LightWeight One Is 522 GB If you want to make it custom You will suprised
We Would Give LXDE A Workstation 17.64
Also We Would Give LXQT An 17.63 .62
